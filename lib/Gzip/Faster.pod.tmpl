=head1 NAME

Gzip::Faster - simple and fast gzip and gunzip

=head1 SYNOPSIS

[% INCLUDE "synopsis.pl" | xtidy %]

=head1 VERSION

This documents version [% info.version %] of Gzip::Faster
corresponding to git commit L<[% commit.commit %]|[% info.repo
%]/commit/[% commit.commit %]> made on [% commit.date %].

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module compresses to and decompresses from the gzip and related
formats. See L</About gzip> if you aren't familiar with the gzip
format.

The basic functions of the module are L</gzip> and L</gunzip>, which
convert scalars to and from gzip format. There are also three
convenience functions built on these two: L</gzip_file> reads a file
then compresses it; L</gunzip_file> reads a file then uncompresses it;
and L</gzip_to_file> compresses a scalar and writes it to a file.

Further to this, L</deflate> and L</inflate> work with the L</deflate
format>, which is the same as the gzip format except it has no header
information. L</deflate_raw> and L</inflate_raw> work with the
bare-bones version of this format without checksums.

[% methods = BLOCK %]

If you need to control the compression beyond what is offered by
L</gzip> and L</gunzip>, create a Gzip::Faster object using L</new>,
and compress and uncompress using the L</zip> and L</unzip>
methods. The type of compression can be toggled with L</gzip_format>
and L</raw>. A file name can be set and retrieved from the gzip header
with L</file_name>, and the modification time of the file can be set
and retrieved with L</mod_time>. The level of compression can be
altered with L</level>. Perl flags can be copied into the gzip header
using L</copy_perl_flags>.

[% methods %]

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 gzip

    my $zipped = gzip ($plain);

This compresses C<$plain> into the gzip format. The return value is
the compressed version of C<$plain>. 

[% undefempty('$plain') %] 

=head2 gunzip

    my $plain = gunzip ($zipped);

This uncompresses C<$zipped> and returns the result of the
uncompression. 

[% undefempty('$zipped') %] 
It throws a fatal error if C<$zipped> is not in the gzip format.

=head2 gzip_file

    my $zipped = gzip_file ('file');

This reads the contents of F<file> into memory and then runs L</gzip>
on the file's contents. The return value and the possible errors are
the same as L</gzip>, plus this may also throw an error if C<open>
fails.  To write a file name, use 

    my $zipped = gzip_file ('file', file_name => 'file');

The modification time can also be written:

    my $zipped = gzip_file ('file', file_name => 'file', mod_time => time ());

[% since('gzip_file','0.04') %] File name writing was added in version
0.18. Modification time writing was added in version 0.19.

=head2 gunzip_file

    my $plain = gunzip_file ('file.gz');

This reads the contents of F<file.gz> into memory and then runs
L</gunzip> on the file's contents. The return value and the possible
errors are the same as L</gunzip>, plus this may also throw an error
if C<open> fails. To retrieve a file name, use

    my $plain = gunzip_file ('file.gz', file_name => \my $file_name);

Provide a scalar reference to the C<file_name> argument. Your
reference is filled with the file name from the header of
F<file.gz>. If F<file.gz> does not contain file name information, your
reference will be given the undefined value.

The modification time in the header can also be read into a reference:

    my $plain = gunzip_file ('file.gz', file_name => \my $file_name,
	                     mod_time => \my $mod_time);

[% since('gunzip_file','0.04') %] File name reading was added in version
0.18. Modification time reading was added in version 0.19.

=head2 gzip_to_file

    gzip_to_file ($plain, 'file.gz');

This compresses C<$plain> in memory using L</gzip> and writes the
compressed content to 'file.gz'. There is no return value. The errors
are the same as L</gzip>, and this may also throw an error if C<open>
fails. To write a file name into the header information of your file,
use

    gzip_to_file ($plain, 'file.gz', file_name => 'file');

[% since('gzip_to_file','0.08') %] File name writing was added in
version 0.18. Modification time writing was added in version 0.19.

=head2 deflate

    my $deflated = deflate ($plain);

This compresses C<$plain> into the deflate format. The deflate format
is similar to the L</gzip> format, except that it doesn't contain a
gzip header. The output of C<deflate> can be inflated either with
L</inflate> or with L</gunzip>.

[% undefempty('$plain') %]

For an example using L</deflate> to write a PNG image file, see [%
file("t/png.t") %] in the module's tests.

[% since('deflate','0.16') %]

=head2 inflate

    my $inflated = inflate ($deflated);

This inflates the output of L</deflate>. For all practical purposes
this is identical to L</gunzip>, and it's included only for
completeness. In other words, you can use inflate and gunzip
interchangeably.

[% undefempty('$deflated') %]

[% since('inflate','0.16') %]

=head2 deflate_raw

    my $zipped = deflate_raw ($plain);

This is similar to L</deflate>, except that it doesn't write check sum
values in the data. The output is incompatible with L</inflate> and
L</gunzip>, and must be inflated with L</inflate_raw>. See L</raw
deflate format> for details.

[% undefempty('$plain') %]

[% since('deflate_raw','0.16') %]

=head2 inflate_raw

    my $plain = inflate_raw ($zipped);

This inflates data output by L</deflate_raw>. It won't work on the
output of L</gzip> and L</deflate>. See L</raw
deflate format> for details.

[% undefempty('$zipped') %] 
It throws a fatal error if its input is not in the deflate format.

[% since('inflate_raw','0.16') %]

=head1 METHODS

This section describes the object-oriented interface of Gzip::Faster,
which offers closer control over various options for compression.

[% methods %]

=head2 new

    my $gf = Gzip::Faster->new ();

Create a Gzip::Faster object. The return value defaults to gzip
compression. This can be altered with L</gzip_format> and L</raw>.

[% since('new','0.16') %]

=head2 zip

    my $zipped = $gf->zip ($plain);

Compress C<$plain>. The type of compression can be set with L</gzip>
and L</raw>.

[% undefempty('$plain') %] 

[% since('zip','0.16') %]

=head2 unzip

    my $plain = $gf->unzip ($zipped);

Uncompress C<$zipped>. The type of uncompression can be set with
L</gzip> and L</raw>.

[% undefempty('$zipped') %] 

[% since('unzip','0.16') %]

=head2 copy_perl_flags

    $gf->copy_perl_flags (1);

Copy some of the Perl flags (currently the utf8 flag) into the header
of the gzipped data.

Please see L</Browser bugs and Gzip::Faster> for reasons why you might
not want to use this feature.

This feature of the module was restored in version 0.16. 

=head2 file_name

    my $filename = $gf->file_name ();
    $gf->file_name ('this.gz');
    my $zipped = $gf->zip ($something);

Get or set the file name in the compressed output. The file name is a
feature of the gzip format which is used, for example, when you use
the command C<gzip -d file.gz>. It tells C<gzip> what to call the file
after it's uncompressed. 

The file_name method is only useful for the gzip format, since the
deflate format does not have a header to store a name into. To prevent
accidental re-use of a file name, when you set a file name with
L</file_name>, then use L</zip>, the file name is deleted from the
object, so it needs to be set each time L</zip> is called. If you set
a file name with L</file_name> then call L</unzip>, that file name may
be deleted.

The following example demonstrates storing and then retrieving the
name:

[% example('file-name') %]

A potential problem is that [% info.colon %] has a hard-coded limit of
1024 bytes as the maximum length of file name it can read back. This
is because a length of some kind is required by zlib, and there is no
sensible way to negotiate the required length with zlib. Please
inspect the source code of F<inflate.c> in zlib (line 786 in zlib
version 1.2.11) for confirmation. If you need longer file names, alter
the value of the macro C<GF_FILE_NAME_MAX> in the file
F<gzip-faster-perl.c> in the top level of the distribution and
recompile the module.

[% since('file_name','0.16') %]

=head2 gzip_format

    $gf->gzip_format (1);

Switch the compression between the L</gzip format> and the L</deflate
format>. A true value turns on the gzip format, and a false value
turns on the deflate format. The default is gzip format. Switching on
gzip format on an object automatically switches off L</raw> format on
the object.

[% since('gzip_format','0.16') %]

=head2 raw

    $gf->raw (1);

Switch between the raw deflate and deflate formats. A true value turns
on the L</raw deflate format>, and a false value turns off the raw
deflate format. Switching this on has the side effect of automatically
switching off L</gzip_format>. Thus the sequence

    $gf->gzip_format (1);
    $gf->raw (1);
    $gf->raw (0);

puts C<$gf> in the non-raw deflate format.

[% since('raw','0.16') %]

=head2 level

    $gf->level (9);

Set the level of compression, from 0 (no compression) to 9 (best
compression). Values outside the levels cause a warning and the level
to be set to the nearest valid value, for example a value of 100
causes the level to be set to 9. The higher the level of compression,
the more time it takes to compute. The default value is a compromise
between speed and quality of compression.

[% since('level','0.16') %]

=head2 mod_time

    $gf->mod_time (time ());
    my $mod_time = $gf->mod_time ();

Set or get the file modification time in the gzip header. The
modification time is an unsigned integer which represents the number
of seconds since the Unix epoch. This only applies to L</gzip_format>
compression.

[% since('mod_time','0.19') %]

=head1 PERFORMANCE

This section compares the performance of Gzip::Faster with
L<IO::Compress::Gzip> / L<IO::Uncompress::Gunzip> and
L<Compress::Raw::Zlib>.  These results are produced by the file
F<bench/benchmarks.pl> in the distribution.

=head2 Short text

This section compares the performance of Gzip::Faster and other
modules on a short piece of English text. Gzip::Faster is about five
times faster to load, seven times faster to compress, and twenty-five
times faster to uncompress than L<IO::Compress::Gzip> and
L<IO::Uncompress::Gunzip>. Round trips are about ten times faster with
Gzip::Faster.

Compared to L<Compress::Raw::Zlib>, load times are about one and a
half times faster, round trips are about three times faster,
compression is about two and a half times faster, and decompression is
about six times faster.

The versions used in this test are as follows:

[% short.versions | indent (4) %]

The size after compression is as follows:

[% short.size | indent (4) %]

Here is a comparison of load times:

[% short.load | indent (4) %]

Here is a comparison of a round-trip:

[% short.round | indent (4) %]

Here is a comparison of gzip (compression) only:

[% short.gzip | indent (4) %]

Here is a comparison of gunzip (decompression) only:

[% short.gunzip | indent (4) %]

=head2 Long text

This section compares the compression on a 2.2 megabyte file of
Chinese text, which is the Project Gutenberg version of Journey to the
West, L<http://www.gutenberg.org/files/23962/23962-0.txt>, with the
header and footer text removed.

The versions used in this test are as above.

The sizes are as follows:

[% long.size | indent (4) %]

Note that the size of the file compressed with the command-line gzip,
with the default compression, is identical to the size with
Gzip::Faster::gzip, except for the 12 bytes in the file version used
to store the file name:

    $ gzip --keep chinese.txt
    $ ls -l chinese.txt.gz 
    -rw-r--r--  1 ben  ben  995835 Oct 20 18:52 chinese.txt.gz

Here is a comparison of a round-trip:

[% long.round | indent (4) %]

Here is a comparison of gzip (compression) only:

[% long.gzip | indent (4) %]

Here is a comparison of gunzip (decompression) only:

[% long.gunzip | indent (4) %]

For longer files, Gzip::Faster is not much faster. The underlying
library's speed is the main factor.

=head1 BUGS

The module doesn't check whether the input of L</gzip> is already
gzipped, and it doesn't check whether the compression was
effective. That is, it doesn't check whether the output of L</gzip> is
actually smaller than the input.

In L</copy_perl_flags>, only the utf8 flag is implemented. Possible
other things which could be implemented are the read-only and the
taint flags.

As of version [% info.version %], there is no way to read or write the
OS, comment, or text fields of the gzip header. The "extra" field of
the gzip header is co-opted by L</copy_perl_flags>. There is no way to
set the value of the parameter C<memLevel> which controls how much
memory the compression routines like L</gzip> use.

[% info.colon %] does not offer incremental compression or
decompression, so it's not suitable for reading and writing very long
streams of data. Some of the other Perl modules listed in
L</Alternatives> offer these if you require them. See also
L</PERFORMANCE>.

=head2 Browser bugs and Gzip::Faster

Some web browsers have bugs which may affect users of this module.

Using L</copy_perl_flags> with utf8-encoded text trips a browser bug
in the Firefox web browser where it produces a content encoding error
message.

Using deflate rather than gzip compression trips browser bugs in older
versions of Internet Explorer, which mistakenly say they can handle
the deflate format, but in fact can only handle gzip format.

=head1 EXPORTS

The module exports L</gzip>, L</gunzip>, L</gzip_file>,
L</gunzip_file>, and L</gzip_to_file> by default. You can switch this
blanket exporting off with

    use Gzip::Faster ();

or

    use Gzip::Faster 'gunzip';

whereby you only get C<gunzip> and not the other functions
exported. The functions L</inflate>, L</deflate>, L</inflate_raw> and
L</deflate_raw> are exported on demand only. You can export all the
functions from the module using

    use Gzip::Faster ':all';

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item Data input to inflate is not in libz format

(Fatal) The data given to L</gunzip>, L</inflate>, L</inflate_raw>, or
L</unzip> was not in the compressed format.

=item Error opening '$file': $!

(Fatal) This may be produced by L</gunzip_file>, L</gzip_file>, or
L</gzip_to_file>.

=item Error closing '$file': $!

(Fatal) This may be produced by L</gunzip_file>, L</gzip_file>, or
L</gzip_to_file>.

=item wrong format: perl flags not copied: use gzip_format(1)

(Warning) The user tried to use L</copy_perl_flags> together with
deflate compression, which isn't possible. Use L</gzip_format> with a
true argument to allow L</copy_perl_flags> to work.

=item wrong format: file name ignored: use gzip_format(1)

(Warning) The user tried to use L</file_name> together with deflate
compression, which isn't possible. Use L</gzip_format> with a true
argument to allow L</file_name> to work.

=item Cannot set compression level to less than %d

(Warning) The user used L</level> with a negative value.

=item Cannot set compression level to more than %d

(Warning) The user used L</level> with a value greater than nine.

=item Cannot write file name to non-scalar reference

(Warning) The user's value for C<file_name> in the optional argument
to L</gunzip_file> was not a scalar reference.

=item Empty input

(Warning) The user tried to compress or decompress the undefined value.

=item Attempt to (un)compress empty string

(Warning) The user tried to compress or decompress an empty string, as in

    my $out = inflate ('');

=back

There are other diagnostic messages in the module to detect bugs. A
list can be obtained by running the C<parse-diagnostics> script which
comes with L<Parse::Diagnostics> on the files F<gzip-faster-perl.c>
and F<lib/Gzip/Faster.pm> in the distribution.

=head1 INSTALLATION

Installation follows standard Perl methods. Detailed instructions can
be found in the file [% file("README") %] in the distribution. The
following are some extra notes for people who get stuck.

Gzip::Faster requires the compression library L</zlib> (also called
C<libz>) to be installed on your computer. The following message
printed during C<perl Makefile.PL>:

    You don't seem to have zlib available on your system.

or

    Warning (mostly harmless): No library found for -lz

or the following message at run-time:

    undefined symbol: inflate

indicate that Gzip::Faster was unable to link to C<libz>.

=head2 Ubuntu Linux

On Ubuntu Linux, you may need to install C<zlib1g-dev> using the
following command:

    sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev

=head2 Windows

Unfortunately at this time the module doesn't seem to install on
ActiveState Perl. You can check the current status at
L<http://code.activestate.com/ppm/Gzip-Faster/>. However, the module
seems to install without problems on Strawberry Perl, so if you cannot
install via ActiveState, you could try that instead.

=head1 SEE ALSO

=head2 About gzip

[% MACRO rfc(x) BLOCK -%]
L<RFC [% x %]|https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc[% x %].txt>
[%- END %]

The gzip and deflate formats are closely related formats for
compressing information. They are used for compressing web pages to
reduce the amount of data sent, for compressing source code files, or
in applications such as MATLAB files or PNG images. 

These formats are formally described by [% rfc(1950) %] (ZLIB
Compressed Data Format Specification), [% rfc(1951) %] (DEFLATE
Compressed Data Format Specification), and [% rfc(1952) %] (GZIP file
format specification). The library L</zlib> implements the formats.

=head2 Alternatives

The following alternatives to this module may also be useful.

=over

=item Command-line gzip

To use the command line utility C<gzip>, use

    system ("gzip file");

or put the command in backquotes, like C<`gzip file`>.

=item mod_deflate and mod_gzip

These are Apache web server modules which compress web outputs
immediately after you produce them, and before sending to the user.

=item L<PerlIO::gzip>

This is a Perl extension to provide a PerlIO layer to
gzip/gunzip. That means you can just add C<:gzip> when you open a file
to read or write compressed files:

    open my $in, "<:gzip", 'file.gz'

    open my $out, ">:gzip", 'file.gz'

and you never have to deal with the gzip format.

=head1 GLOSSARY

This section explains some of the terminology of the Gzip/zlib
compression system.

=over

=item deflate format

The deflate format is the same as the L</gzip format> except that it
does not contain the header with the additional information such as
the file name and modification time. The deflate format may or may not
include a checksum. If it does not include the checksum, it is the
L</raw deflate format>. The deflate format is the format used within
PNG images, for example.

=item gzip format

The gzip format is the same as the L</deflate format> except that it
includes a header which may contain such things as a file name or a
modification time. The gzip format is the one used by the command-line
utility gzip in such things as .tar.gz files.

=item raw deflate format

The raw deflate format is a form of the L</deflate format> without an
Adler-32 checksum. (The terminology "raw deflate" for this format is
from L<the zlib manual|http://zlib.net/manual.html> and does not
appear in the RFCs.)

=item zlib

zlib is the implementation of the gzip and deflate algorithms.  zlib
is necessary to install Gzip::Faster. It is described at
L<http://zlib.net>.

=back

=head1 HISTORY

This module started as an experimental benchmark against
L<IO::Compress::Gzip> when profiling revealed that some programs were
spending the majority of their time in L<IO::Compress::Gzip>. Since I
(Ben Bullock) knew that zlib was fast, I was surprised by the time the
Perl code was taking. I wrote Gzip::Faster to test IO::Compress::Gzip
against a simplistic gzip wrapper. I released the module to CPAN
because the results were very striking. See L</PERFORMANCE> above for
details.

Gzip::Faster's ancestor is the example program C<zpipe> supplied with
zlib. See L<http://zlib.net/zpipe.c>. Gzip::Faster is C<zpipe> reading
to and and writing from Perl scalars.

Version 0.16 added L</deflate> and related functions and the
object-oriented functions.

Version 0.18 added the ability to set and get file names to the
g*zip*file functions, and version 0.19 added modification times.

Version 0.21 added warnings upon input of empty strings to L</gzip>,
L</gunzip>, and friends.

=head1 ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS

zgrim reported an important bug related to zlib.

Aristotle Pagaltzis contributed the benchmarking code for
L<Compress::Raw::Zlib>.

The tests in F<t/png.t> and the example L</View the image data of a
PNG> use material taken from L<Image::PNG::Write::BW> by Andrea Nall
